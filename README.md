# What this provides
* basic eslintrc rules (`npm run-script lint`)
* basic editor config for consitent line endings/tabbing
* react/redux/react-redux dependencies
* flow config for type annotations (brew install flow is a prereq)
* webpack loader for transpiling es6/jsx/flow (run as `npm run-script dev`)
* node ~6.2.0 and npm ^3.8.9
* A very basic directory structure
